.SH NAME
buf-dep-graph - Print the dependency graph


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbuf dep graph  [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
As an example, if module in directory "src/proto" depends on module "buf.build/foo/bar"
from the BSR with commit "12345", and "buf.build/foo/bar:12345" depends on module "buf.build/foo/baz"
from the BSR with commit "67890", the following will be printed:

.PP
digraph {

.PP
"src/proto" -> "buf.build/foo/bar:12345"
  "buf.build/foo/bar:12345" -> "buf.build/foo/baz:67890"

.PP
}

.PP
The actual output may vary between CLI versions and has no stability guarantees, however the output
will always be in valid DOT format. If you'd like us to produce an alternative stable format
(such as a Protobuf message that we serialize to JSON), let us know!

.PP
See https://graphviz.org to explore Graphviz and the DOT language.
Installation of graphviz will vary by platform, but is easy to install using homebrew:

.PP
brew install graphviz

.PP
You can easily visualize a dependency graph using the dot tool:

.PP
buf dep graph | dot -Tpng >| graph.png && open graph.png
The first argument is the source or module to print the dependency graph for, which must be one of format [dir,git,mod,protofile,tar,zip].
This defaults to "." if no argument is specified.
